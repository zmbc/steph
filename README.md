At one point, I was interested in learning Haskell, and thought I would work on a software project around NBA statistics. I decided to make a toy project, a thin abstraction layer over the [kawhi library](https://github.com/thunky-monk/kawhi), as a way of learning a bit more about both. Haskell and NBA statistics both fell out of my priorities and I never finished this.
